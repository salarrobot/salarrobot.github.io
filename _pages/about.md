I'm Salar Mokhtari, a researcher at the ERC Laboratory, National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), specializing in Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL), and humanoid robotics.

My research focuses on developing learning-based control systems that enable humanoid robots to perceive, adapt, and act intelligently in complex, dynamic environments. I’m particularly interested in how advanced RL algorithms can empower robots to perform human-like tasks — such as walking, balancing, object manipulation, and autonomous decision-making — with minimal hard-coded instructions.

At NTNU, I work at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and embodied intelligence, striving to bridge theoretical advancements in Deep RL with practical implementations on real robotic platforms.
