I'm Salar Mokhtari, a robotics developer and researcher passionate about intelligent systems, autonomous control, and human-robot interaction. My work lies at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and software engineering, where I explore how machines can learn, adapt, and work seamlessly with humans.

With a deep interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep RL, especially in the context of humanoid robots, I combine theory with practice — building systems that move, learn, and think. Whether it's developing simulations, coding control algorithms, or writing research papers, I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems.

This site reflects my journey — the challenges I tackle, the ideas I explore, and the knowledge I aim to share along the way.
